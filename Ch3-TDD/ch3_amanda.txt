Implementation of test-driven development:
	write a test
	test fails as there is no code
	write the minimum code to make the test pass
	write another test
	test fails
	adapt and extend current code
	repeat until you can write no more tests
Repeat this process for every feature, as necessary.

Rule 1: You don't write functional code, unless it makes one test pass.
Rule 2: You only write the code you need to make that one test pass.
