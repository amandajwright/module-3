Phonebook project

1. Ideation
Checking out current BT phoneboke website. Thinking about what feature we'd like to retain/develop.
Visit from BT developer to give insight into project requirements and potential ways of approaching the project.

2. Requirements gathering
The story cards in the project outline: "Given I... When I... Then I..."
Team of three trainee developers, with similar levels of python/flask/js experience and knowledge. Also an instructor on hand to help with problems! Also the internet.

3. Development
First created an app that worked on the command line. Then introduced flask and refactored code accordingly. Then introduced some js and refactored code again!
Broke code down into as simple as possible functions. Applied clean code principles.

4. Testing
Unit testing and integration testing on command line version. Validation testing on flask version.
User acceptance testing (between us and on presentation to instructor).

5. Deployment
Getting project on to Heroku as an app.
Presentation to class.

6. Maintenance
Maybe update database with fuller data?
Have database on github so can be accessed after course has finished and laptops handed back.
